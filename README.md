# SPAM MESSAGES DETECTOR-<br>
### Project Description<br>
The "Spam Message Detector" project aims to build a machine learning model
using logistic regression to classify messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). 
Leveraging libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, NLTK, and sklearn, 
the project demonstrates proficiency in data processing, visualization, statistics, 
critical thinking, and problem-solving.

Utilizing a dataset containing labeled messages, the project preprocesses the data, 
explores its distribution through charts generated using matplotlib and seaborn, 
and conducts statistical analysis to gain insights. The data is then transformed 
and prepared for training the logistic regression model.
The logistic regression model is trained using sklearn, optimizing hyperparameters 
to achieve optimal performance. After training, the model is evaluated using metrics 
such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in classifying 
spam and ham messages..<br>
